  abstract = {A methodology is presented to rank universities on the basis of the lists of programmes the students applied for. We exploit a crucial feature of the centralised assignment system to higher education in Hungary: a student is admitted to the first programme where the score limit is achieved. This makes it possible to derive a partial preference order of each applicant. Our approach integrates the information from all students participating in the system, is free of multicollinearity among the indicators, and contains few ad hoc parameters. The procedure is implemented to rank faculties in the Hungarian higher education between 2001 and 2016. We demonstrate that the ranking given by the least squares method has favourable theoretical properties, is robust with respect to the aggregation of preferences, and performs well in practice. The suggested ranking is worth considering as a reasonable alternative to the standard composite indices.}

  abstract={The paper suggests a family of paired comparison-based scoring procedures for ranking the participants of a Swiss system chess team tournament. We present the challenges of ranking in Swiss system, the features of individual and team competitions as well as the failures of the official rankings based on lexicographical order. The tournament is represented as a ranking problem such that the linearly-solvable row sum (score), generalized row sum, and least squares methods have favourable axiomatic properties. Two chess team European championships are analysed as case studies. Final rankings are compared by their distances and visualized with multidimensional scaling. Differences to the official ranking are revealed by the decomposition of the least squares method. Rankings are evaluated by prediction power, retrodictive performance, and stability. The paper argues for the use of least squares method with a results matrix favouring match points on the basis of its relative insensitivity to the choice between match and board points, retrodictive accuracy, and robustness.},

The bilateral relationships may reflect the outcomes of a sport competition, product comparisons, or evaluation of political candidates and policies. It is shown that the rating vector can be obtained as a limit point of an iterative process based on the scores in almost all cases. The calculation is interpreted on an undirected graph with loops attached to some nodes, revealing that the procedure takes into account not only the given object's results but also the strength of objects compared with it. We explore the connection between this method and another procedure defined for ranking the nodes in a digraph, the positional power measure.

abstract = { The task of ranking individuals or teams, based on a set of comparisons between pairs, arises in various contexts, including sporting competitions and the analysis of dominance hierarchies among animals and humans. Given data on which competitors beat which others, the challenge is to rank the competitors from best to worst. Here we study the problem of computing rankings when there are multiple, potentially conflicting types of comparison, such as multiple types of dominance behaviours among animals. We assume that we do not know a priori what information each behaviour conveys about the ranking, or even whether they convey any information at all. Nonetheless, we show that it is possible to compute a ranking in this situation and present a fast method for doing so, based on a combination of an expectation–maximization algorithm and a modified Bradley–Terry model. We give a selection of example applications to both animal and human competition. }

  journal = {Journal of Physics: Complexity},
  abstract = {We define the topological Dirac equation describing the evolution of a topological wave function on networks or on simplicial complexes. On networks, the topological wave function describes the dynamics of topological signals or cochains, i.e. dynamical signals defined both on nodes and on links. On simplicial complexes the wave function is also defined on higher-dimensional simplices. Therefore the topological wave function satisfies a relaxed condition of locality as it acquires the same value along simplices of dimension larger than zero. The topological Dirac equation defines eigenstates whose dispersion relation is determined by the spectral properties of the Dirac operator defined on networks and generalized network structures including simplicial complexes and multiplex networks. On simplicial complexes the Dirac equation leads to multiple energy bands. On multiplex networks the topological Dirac equation can be generalized to distinguish between different mutlilinks leading to a natural definition of rotations of the topological spinor. The topological Dirac equation is here initially formulated on a spatial network or simplicial complex for describing the evolution of the topological wave function in continuous time. This framework is also extended to treat the topological Dirac equation on 1 + d lattices describing a discrete space-time with one temporal dimension and d spatial dimensions with d ∈ {1, 2, 3}. It is found that in this framework space-like and time-like links are only distinguished by the choice of the directional Dirac operator and are otherwise structurally indistinguishable. This work includes also the discussion of numerical results obtained by implementing the topological Dirac equation on simplicial complex models and on real simple and multiplex network data.}

abstract={We propose a technique that we call HodgeRank for ranking data that may be incomplete and imbalanced, characteristics common in modern datasets coming from e-commerce and internet applications. We are primarily interested in cardinal data based on scores or ratings though our methods also give specific insights on ordinal data. From raw ranking data, we construct pairwise rankings, represented as edge flows on an appropriate graph. Our statistical ranking method exploits the graph Helmholtzian, which is the graph theoretic analogue of the Helmholtz operator or vector Laplacian, in much the same way the graph Laplacian is an analogue of the Laplace operator or scalar Laplacian. We shall study the graph Helmholtzian using combinatorial Hodge theory, which provides a way to unravel ranking information from edge flows. In particular, we show that every edge flow representing pairwise ranking can be resolved into two orthogonal components, a gradient flow that represents the l2-optimal global ranking and a divergence-free flow (cyclic) that measures the validity of the global ranking obtained---if this is large, then it indicates that the data does not have a good global ranking. This divergence-free flow can be further decomposed orthogonally into a curl flow (locally cyclic) and a harmonic flow (locally acyclic but globally cyclic); these provides information on whether inconsistency in the ranking data arises locally or globally. When applied to statistical ranking problems, Hodge decomposition sheds light on whether a given dataset may be globally ranked in a meaningful way or if the data is inherently inconsistent and thus could not have any reasonable global ranking; in the latter case it provides information on the nature of the inconsistencies. An obvious advantage over the NP-hardness of Kemeny optimization is that HodgeRank may be easily computed via a linear least squares regression. We also discuss connections with well-known ordinal ranking techniques such as Kemeny optimization and Borda count from social choice theory.},

It has served to study human behavior from the perspective of a wide number of disciplines, from cognitive skills such as memory and learning, to aspects like innovation and decision-making. Given that an extensive documentation of chess games played throughout history is available, it is possible to perform detailed and statistically significant studies about this sport.

One of the networks includes games that were played over-the-board and the other contains games played on the Internet. We study the main topological characteristics of the networks, such as degree distribution and correlations, transitivity and community structure. We complement the structural analysis by incorporating players' level of play as node metadata. Although both networks are topologically different, we show that in both cases players gather in communities according to their expertise and that an emergent rich-club structure, composed by the top-rated players, is also present.},

abstract="In this paper we extend and generalize the standard random walk theory (or spectral graph theory) on undirected graphs to digraphs. In particular, we introduce and define a (normalized) digraph Laplacian matrix, and prove that 1) its Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse is the (discrete) Green's function of the digraph Laplacian matrix (as an operator on digraphs), and 2) it is the normalized fundamental matrix of the Markov chain governing random walks on digraphs. Using these results, we derive new formula for computing hitting and commute times in terms of the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of the digraph Laplacian, or equivalently, the singular values and vectors of the digraph Laplacian. Furthermore, we show that the Cheeger constant defined in [6] is intrinsically a quantity associated with undirected graphs. This motivates us to introduce a metric -- the largest singular value of {\$}{\backslash}Delta:=({\backslash}tilde{\{}{\backslash}cal L{\}}-{\backslash}tilde{\{}{\backslash}cal L{\}}^T)/2{\$}-- to quantify and measure the degree of asymmetry in a digraph. Using this measure, we establish several new results, such as a tighter bound (than that of Fill's in [9] and Chung's in [6]) on the Markov chain mixing rate, and a bound on the second smallest singular value of {\$}{\backslash}tilde{\{}{\backslash}cal L{\}}{\$}.",

The probabilistic description is provided by a non-homogeneous Markov chain, which is not assumed on the basis of a model of the microscopic interactions but rather derived from the knowledge of the macroscopic fluxes traversing the system through a maximum entropy rate principle.},

abstract = {The tendency of the entropy to a maximum as an isolated system is relaxed to the equilibrium (the second law of thermodynamics) has been known since the mid-19th century. However, independent theoretical and applied studies, which suggested the maximization of the entropy production during nonequilibrium processes (the so-called maximum entropy production principle, MEPP), appeared in the 20th century. Publications on this topic were fragmented and different research teams, which were concerned with this principle, were unaware of studies performed by other scientists. As a result, the recognition and the use of MEPP by a wider circle of researchers were considerably delayed. The objectives of the present review consist in summation and analysis of studies dealing with MEPP. The first part of the review is concerned with the thermodynamic and statistical basis of the principle (including the relationship of MEPP with the second law of thermodynamics and Prigogine's principle). Various existing applications of the principle to analysis of nonequilibrium systems will be discussed in the second part.}

abstract={In this paper we discuss two issues related to model reduction of deterministic or stochastic processes. The first is the relationship of the spectral properties of the dynamics on the attractor of the original, high-dimensional dynamical system with the properties and possibilities for model reduction. We review some elements of the spectral theory of dynamical systems. We apply this theory to obtain a decomposition of the process that utilizes spectral properties of the linear Koopman operator associated with the asymptotic dynamics on the attractor. This allows us to extract the almost periodic part of the evolving process. The remainder of the process has continuous spectrum. The second topic we discuss is that of model validation, where the original, possibly high-dimensional dynamics and the dynamics of the reduced model -- that can be deterministic or stochastic -- are compared in some norm. Using the ``statistical Takens theorem'' proven in (Mezi{\'{c}}, I. and Banaszuk, A. Physica D, 2004) we argue that comparison of average energy contained in the finite-dimensional projection is one in the hierarchy of functionals of the field that need to be checked in order to assess the accuracy of the projection.},

abstract={Koopman and von Neumann (KvN) extended the Liouville equation by introducing a phase space function {\$}{\$}S^{\{}(K){\}}(q,p,t){\$}{\$}S(K)(q,p,t)whose physical meaning is unknown. We show that a different S(q, p, t), with well-defined physical meaning, may be introduced without destroying the attractive ``quantum-like'' mathematical features of the KvN theory. This new S(q, p, t) is the classical action expressed in phase space coordinates. It defines a mapping between observables and operators which preserves the Lie bracket structure. The new evolution equation reduces to Schr{\"o}dinger's equation if functions on phase space are reduced to functions on configuration space. This new kind of ``quantization'' does not only establish a correspondence between observables and operators, but provides in addition a derivation of quantum operators and evolution equations from corresponding classical entities. It is performed by replacing {\$}{\$}{\backslash}frac{\{}{\backslash}partial {\}}{\{}{\backslash}partial p{\}}{\$}{\$}∂∂pby 0 and p by {\$}{\$}{\backslash}frac{\{}{\backslash}hbar {\}}{\{}{\backslash}imath {\}} {\backslash}frac{\{}{\backslash}partial {\}}{\{}{\backslash}partial q{\}}{\$}{\$}ħ{\i}∂∂q, thus providing an explanation for the common quantization rules.},

abstract={We review the Schwinger-Keldysh, or in-in, formalism for studying quantum dynamics of systems out-of-equilibrium. The main motivation is to rephrase well known facts in the subject in a mathematically elegant setting, by exhibiting a set of BRST symmetries inherent in the construction. We show how these fundamental symmetries can be made manifest by working in a superspace formalism. We argue that this rephrasing is extremely efficacious in understanding low energy dynamics following the usual renormalization group approach, for the BRST symmetries are robust under integrating out degrees of freedom. In addition we discuss potential generalizations of the formalism that allow us to compute out-of-time-order correlation functions that have been the focus of recent attention in the context of chaos and scrambling. We also outline a set of problems ranging from stochastic dynamics, hydrodynamics, dynamics of entanglement in QFTs, and the physics of black holes and cosmology, where we believe this framework could play a crucial role in demystifying various confusions. Our companion paper [1] describes in greater detail the mathematical framework embodying the topological symmetries we uncover here.},

    We set up a renormalization group scheme by expanding an arbitrary scalar field living on the nodes of an arbitrary network, in terms of the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian. The renormalization transformation involves, as usual, the integration over the more "rapidly varying" components of the field, corresponding to eigenvectors with larger eigenvalues, and then rescaling.

Our algorithm breaks scalability barriers in the method of Chu et al. (1999) by abandoning adaptive cooling based on variance. The resulting gains in parallel efficiency are much larger than the loss of serial efficiency from lack of adaptive cooling. Our algorithm resamples the states across processors periodically. The resampling interval is tuned according to the success rate for each specific number of processors. We further present an adaptive method to determine the resampling interval based on the adoption rate. This adaptive method is able to achieve nearly identical parallel efficiency but higher success rates compared to the fixed interval one using the best interval found.},

    abstract = { CG, SYMMLQ, and MINRES are Krylov subspace methods for solving symmetric systems of linear equations. When these methods are applied to an incompatible system (that is, a singular symmetric least-squares problem), CG could break down and SYMMLQ's solution could explode, while MINRES would give a least-squares solution but not necessarily the minimum-length (pseudoinverse) solution. This understanding motivates us to design a MINRES-like algorithm to compute minimum-length solutions to singular symmetric systems. MINRES uses QR factors of the tridiagonal matrix from the Lanczos process (where R is upper-tridiagonal). MINRES-QLP uses a QLP decomposition (where rotations on the right reduce R to lower-tridiagonal form). On ill-conditioned systems (singular or not), MINRES-QLP can give more accurate solutions than MINRES. We derive preconditioned MINRES-QLP, new stopping rules, and better estimates of the solution and residual norms, the matrix norm, and the condition number. }

Julia is designed to be easy and fast and questions notions generally held to be “laws of nature" by practitioners of numerical computing: \beginlist \item High-level dynamic programs have to be slow. \item One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment. \item There are parts of a system appropriate for the programmer, and other parts that are best left untouched as they have been built by the experts. \endlist We introduce the Julia programming language and its design---a dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, which is what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming. Julia shows that one can achieve machine performance without sacrificing human convenience.}

abstract={Ramon Llull (Majorca c.1232--1316) is one of the earliest founding fathers of voting theory and social choice theory. The present article places Llull's contributions and discussion in the historical context of elections in the medieval Church and the emergence of majority rule as a new general principle for making enforceable collective decisions in replacement of traditional unanimous requirements. To make the majority principle operational, Llull initially proposed a system of exhaustive binary comparisons that is more efficacious in producing a winner than the Condorcet system, in anticipation to the so called Copeland procedure. In contrast to some previous tentative suggestions, careful reading of Llull's papers demonstrates that he did not propose a rank-order count system, such as those proposed later on by Cusanus and Borda. A new hypothesis is presented to explain Llull's later proposal of an eliminatory system of partial binary comparisons. Some performance of Llull's voting systems is estimated by innovative analysis of results in certain modern sports tournaments.},

Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. The prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http://google.stanford.edu/ To engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of Web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the Web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and Web proliferation, creating a Web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale Web search engine — the first such detailed public description we know of to date. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want.}

abstract = { Network-based modeling of complex systems and data using the language of graphs has become an essential topic across a range of different disciplines. Arguably, this graph-based perspective derives its success from the relative simplicity of graphs: A graph consists of nothing more than a set of vertices and a set of edges, describing relationships between pairs of such vertices. This simple combinatorial structure makes graphs interpretable and flexible modeling tools. The simplicity of graphs as system models, however, has been scrutinized in the literature recently. Specifically, it has been argued from a variety of different angles that there is a need for higher-order networks, which go beyond the paradigm of modeling pairwise relationships, as encapsulated by graphs. In this survey article we take stock of these recent developments. Our goals are to clarify (i) what higher-order networks are, (ii) why these are interesting objects of study, and (iii) how they can be used in applications. }

abstract={Complex networks have become the main paradigm for modelling the dynamics of interacting systems. However, networks are intrinsically limited to describing pairwise interactions, whereas real-world systems are often characterized by higher-order interactions involving groups of three or more units. Higher-order structures, such as hypergraphs and simplicial complexes, are therefore a better tool to map the real organization of many social, biological and man-made systems. Here, we highlight recent evidence of collective behaviours induced by higher-order interactions, and we outline three key challenges for the physics of higher-order systems.},

abstract = { Network science has evolved into an indispensable platform for studying complex systems. But recent research has identified limits of classical networks, where links connect pairs of nodes, to comprehensively describe group interactions. Higher-order networks, where a link can connect more than two nodes, have therefore emerged as a new frontier in network science. Since group interactions are common in social, biological and technological systems, higher-order networks have recently led to important new discoveries across many fields of research. Here, we review these works, focusing in particular on the novel aspects of the dynamics that emerges on higher-order networks. We cover a variety of dynamical processes that have thus far been studied, including different synchronization phenomena, contagion processes, the evolution of cooperation and consensus formation. We also outline open challenges and promising directions for future research. }

abstract={A paramount research challenge in network and complex systems science is to understand the dissemination of diseases, information and behaviour. The COVID-19 pandemic and the proliferation of misinformation are examples that highlight the importance of these dynamic processes. In recent years, it has become clear that studies of higher-order networks may unlock new avenues for investigating such processes. Despite being in its early stages, the examination of social contagion in higher-order networks has witnessed a surge of research and concepts, revealing different functional forms for the spreading dynamics and offering novel insights. This Review presents a focused overview of this body of literature and proposes a unified formalism that covers most of these forms. The goal is to underscore the similarities and distinctions among various models to motivate further research on the general and universal properties of such models. We also highlight that although the path for additional theoretical exploration appears clear, the empirical validation of these models through data or experiments remains scant, with an unsettled roadmap as of today. We therefore conclude with some perspectives aimed at providing possible research directions that could contribute to a better understanding of this class of dynamical processes, both from a theoretical and a data-oriented point of view.},

journal = {Europhysics Letters},
abstract = {Complexity develops via the incorporation of innovative properties. Chess is one of the most complex strategy games, where expert contenders exercise decision making by imitating old games or introducing innovations. In this work, we study innovation in chess by analyzing how different move sequences are played at the population level. It is found that the probability of exploring a new or innovative move decreases as a power law with the frequency of the preceding move sequence. Chess players also exploit already known move sequences according to their frequencies, following a preferential growth mechanism. Furthermore, innovation in chess exhibits Heaps' law suggesting similarities with the process of vocabulary growth. We propose a robust generative mechanism based on nested Yule-Simon preferential growth processes that reproduces the empirical observations. These results, supporting the self-similar nature of innovations in chess are important in the context of decision making in a competitive scenario, and extend the scope of relevant findings recently discovered regarding the emergence of Zipf's law in chess.}
