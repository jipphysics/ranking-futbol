Experiments with randomly prunned networks generating Shuffled Spanning "Trees".

In the experiments of 2025-10-23, we generated sparse networks via Maximum Spanning "Trees". Here we use the same procedure but, instead of sorting the weighted edges in decreasing order of strength (absolute value of strength), we sort them randomly creating so called Shiffled Spanning "Trees". Clearly, this requires the results of the experiments to be averaged over several repetitions.
