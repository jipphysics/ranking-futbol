Experiments with randomly prunned networks generating Randomly Spanning "Trees".

In the experiments of 2025-10-23, we generated sparse networks via Maximum Spanning "Trees". Here we use the same procedure but, instead of sorting the weighted edges in decreasing order of strength (absolute value of strength) we sort them randomly. Clearly, this requires the results of the experiments to be averated over several repetitions.
